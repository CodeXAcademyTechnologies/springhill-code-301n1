// 2D arrays

// Can represent many things.

// For example, a bitmap image is a 2D array:

let bitmapNull = 
[
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
];

let bitmap0 = 
[
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
];

let bitmap7 = 
[
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
];
// Now, lets figure out some things.
// For example, how many 1's are in each
